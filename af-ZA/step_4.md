## Install MariaDB

MariaDB is a popular database engine. Like PHP, it's widely used on web servers, which is why projects like WordPress use it, and why those projects are so popular.

+ `Change the root password?` - Type in **Y** and press **Enter**

+ `New password:` - Type in a password and press **Enter**, then repeat a second time. **Important:** remember this root password, as you will need it later to set up WordPress.
